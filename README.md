# Advanced-Database-Management-System

Library is collection of all information and resources that is made accessible to university so that they can access or borrow them for their reference. This database system will keep track of the books, videos that are available in the library. It will also track customers who are borrowing books/online resources and their statuses. The database system will also track employees working at different location and branches.
